# What is Cojin?
Cojin is an decentralized cryptocurrency that has the main goal to make starting a crypto project affordable.<br>
Uses the scrypt/pos algorithm with a maximum of 200000 POW blocks that can be mined.<br>
Is cloned from the blackcoin source code.


## Why did we choose the Scrypt/POS algorithm?
We chose scrypt because we wanted make Cojin mineable.
That way the first coins to be made could go to the early investors.<br>
Why POS? because it's more efficient and better for the climate!
No more need for hard working ASICs or other computers to run the blockchain.

## Why was Cojin made?
Cojin was made to learn myself (1NF1N18Y) how cryptocurrency works.
After about 6 months I got some super cool ideas to make Cojin a useful coin in the cryptospace.

## What is our goal?
Our goal is to help crypto projects with small budgets and grow our Cojin network.

## How can we help other crypto projects?
Here are some examples:
> CojinX - A crypto exchange with low listing fees so people can list their own coins without having to spend over $1000.

> CojinPool -  This a crypto pool that runs 24/7 where new coins can be added for free! 10% of the earned fees of all the coins will go back to the devolpers of the coins.<br>
What will happend to the rest of the 90%? 60% will go to the dev team of Cojin for investing back into Cojin. The rest of the fees will be used to airdrop investors in Cojin.

## Cojin history
On February 2, 2022 cojin was released for testing. But was never intended to go live on websites like [miningpoolstats](https://miningpoolstats.stream). <br>
After some months with zero plans me and the small community decided to create a new coin with a new algorithm, Scrypt/pos.<br>
The algorithm change took about 1 month before being released.
After the airdrops were finished the project still didn't have a plan so I, 1NF1N18Y, decided to stop the project for
some time and remove it from and mining pools and [miningpoolstats](https://miningpoolstats.stream).<br>
That took about 3 weeks and now we're back!
New plans and website with a roadmap plus whitepaper and ready for a good future!

## How can a investor in Cojin earn?
You have invested some money into Cojin now what?
Here are some options to choose from:

### Harmony/Cojin:
When Cojin is made on the harmony chain you are able to make LP (liquidity) tokens for Cojin.
That way you can earn fees that are generated from transactions in the Cojin/Harmony exchange. 

### Stake your CJNs:
You can stake your own Cojin to help secure the Cojin blockchain.<br>
If you have between 10000 and 100000 CJN, I suggest you to make a wallet that runs 24/7 with staking on.
That way you can help secure the Cojin blockchain and earning some nice rewards!<br>
**OR**<br>
If you have between 100 and 1000 CJN, I suggest you to put it in the Stakepool.<br>
The Stakepool is on the CJN bot in our discord server, and because other people are staking too, the rewards will be earned much faster than staking in a normal wallet.
Plus this makes you able to earn rewards even though you don't have much CJN.

More options will be added in the future!

## What is the Cojin Network?
The Cojin network is basically all the things that are being used by Cojin, The Cojinpool, Block explorer and stakingpool.

## What is CojinX?
CojinX will be a new exchange with low listing fees for projects willing to add their own coin on the exchange.
Since CojinX isn't ready yet there isn't much information about it.

## Why do we have our own pool?
We made our own pool for Cojin to make sure Cojin is always mineable.
If it were to happen that Cojin isn't on any mining pool it would be unfair for the people that want to mine Cojin.

## Cojin on Harmony chain?
Cojin is planning to make a Harmony/Cojin pair on the Harmony chain. With a "bridge" between the Cojin blockchain and Harmony.
That way we can also have a exchange there. That would benefit investors and users in the Cojin community.

This isn't ready yet! More information will be added when Cojin launches on harmony.


# Disclaimer
Cojin isn't made by a big company with a lot of money for the project. That's why updates and improvements can take long a long time.
Cojin website, nodes and miningpool are being run by me (1NF1N18Y). Because the budget is small a donation could help a lot!

(PS: this whitepaper will be updated every month with results and will keep track of things that happend that month.)
